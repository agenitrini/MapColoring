# MapColoring



First a image in a png file is opened. Then three algorithms are available to color the map, either with 6 or with 5 and finally with 4 color(respectively Euler Algorithm, Kempe Algorithm and Backtracking Algorithm). Note that the last algorithm, using a backtracking approach, is not efficient, in the sense its time complexity is exponential in the number of regions of the map. The two first algorithms are linear.



Some library are necessary to use directly the software:

- Tkinter
- OpenCV
- Pickle
- time, sys, os.

The three first libraries can be easily installed using "pip install".

With small changes the Pickle package would be avoided if necessary.
